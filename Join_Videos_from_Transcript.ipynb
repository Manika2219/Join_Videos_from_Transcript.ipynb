            " Life, you learn a few things by reading about them. You learn a few more things by watching someone do something. You learn a few things by listening to something. But a few things by actually living your life. Now the advice that I'm going to share in this video are the things which I learned by living my life. I'm 24 right now and welcome to a few stories which made me say, fuck it. I want to start this video by telling you a couple of stories from my life. But now when I actually look at these stories, when I actually think about these stories myself, I feel like bro why the fuck did I do that? You'll understand why am I saying what am I exactly saying right now. But let's start with the first story. This was back when I was in school. Most of the time that I actually remember about my life with friends in school. And friends actually played like a huge role in the person that I am today. But this is not a good story or a story that I'm proud of because one random day, one fine day, I was just sitting in the class probably like probably in the first bench or second bench or whatever it is. And then a couple of people were behind me. They were like in the last bench or something. Now I don't know how it started, why it started and all these things. But I could see that these four or five people they started making fun of me. They were actually talking about me. They were like laughing at me. They were like discussing about me. And I can kind of listen to it. They were kind of audible. I think they wanted it to be audible. They wanted to insult me. But what I was more pissed off is there was one of my friends in that group. How could he do it? Why is he doing it? But then I was also thinking like bro what if I go there and I tell something and then it finally ends up to be a fight. And all these five people they start hating me in the class. But if what if that happens. I mean at this point of time I'm completely okay to you know do this. But back then I was a people crazy. I didn't really want people to hate me. I didn't want to make enemies in the class. So I still remember it was probably like a good 10 to 15 minutes of time till I finally went there and I told them bro it's not okay. I'll tell you what exactly happened after that in a while. But before that let's go to the next story. The next story was kind of similar but this time one of the teachers was making fun of me. And I actually wanted to tell her or him in a very respectful manner. Okay sir or ma'am it's not okay. Please stop doing it. I was just like suffering from inside but then I had this fear inside me which was telling don't do it. Don't do it. Don't go and tell the teacher that it's not okay. I was like scared like I have to do it. I have to tell her it's not okay. But then I was also scared. Keep what if it comes out in a wrong way and maybe in the future she or he will hate me. I was just scared. I didn't want to do it. And finally after 10 to 15 minutes of time I finally told her that it's not fine. Again I'll tell you what happened after that. But now let's go to the next story. The stage fear. One random day this was again probably like school. There was this big meeting and like you know probably on the stage there were like people speaking in front of everyone and then there are students who are like sitting over here here here here at every single place right there like bunch of students who are like sitting here. Now suddenly someone asked a question if a student can come out to the stage and like speak in front of everyone. I really wanted to go into the stage and speak in front of everyone. But I was scared. I was like bro what if I go to the stage. What if I you know what? Raise my hand. Like sir I want to come there and start speaking and if I actually go there and then while speaking in front of every single person over there what if I mess it up. What if I just get stuck again it was like a huge battle inside my head right one part of me wanted to really go and like start speaking in front of everyone. But there's one more part was like no there on shut the fuck up don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it. Now I finally went under the stage and I started speaking in front of everyone and guess what? You'll assume your short chalo this is the end of the story. You have to come out of the comfort zone and everything will be okay no. I fucked it up. Just imagine you're on this stage and you started speaking for like 2 minutes, 3 minutes or whatever it is and then 20, 30, 40 no. 200, 300 people are looking at you they're expecting you to speak but you're just there in front of like in front of every single person on the stage with a mic in your hand. They're looking at you they're expecting you to speak and what are you doing? You just got fucking stuck. I just said thank you so much for giving me this golden opportunity and then I just ran off right like I just I was like I just that was too bad man but again the next story this was when I was in college one of my exams went really really bad. I mean I literally studied the whole night I went to the exam I started writing on so writing writing writing I was like chalo four questions five questions were there and then I know it like two or three chalo is cooker taste cooker and then suddenly I was writing writing writing writing and then someone comes to me and they be like wake up. Who I fucking slept inside the exam I was writing writing writing and then I slept in the exam and finally the English letter walks up to me and she's like give me the paper. I'm like oh god shit I just realized that I slept throughout the exam shit and at five pm the results were to be announced. I was here on a call with a friend at five fifty pm I was almost crying I was like my I guess I'll fail. Oh yeah. Gaia and guess what happened I'll you. And the last one is again a story when I was in college I kind of had like a really big crush on this girl and I wanted to tell her this keep you know I I think I think I just had to walk tongue tongue tongue tongue and tell her hey I think I just got stuck that's it I just got stuck I mean I like chalo okay I'll just she'll see you and then I came back again after a month or like two I went back to her and I like bro I think I'm going to be a positive story or a negative story you might end up being a hero or you might end up being a loser for example the first one when I actually finally went to these people and told they're bro I'm not comfortable with you you know what they said they just fucking know me they're like bro Gaia Gaia and then we fought and these people just stopped talking to me and one month later two months later three months later all of them eventually came back now I don't even give a fuck about any of them. Now the second story about the teacher the teacher actually understood what I'm trying to say and she was like oh okay sorry she actually understood it and it was like a winner story I won I'm the fucking hero of this story and then the third one the stage fear one I ended up being a loser I just went on to this stage like a hero I just wanted to speak in front of everyone and what happened to that I just got stuck and I just came it was like a huge embarrassment like I don't know I didn't know how to face everyone the entire day and the next one like I got like the least great possible but I didn't fail I was like still happy I was like bro in fact I didn't end up being a loser in the story and the last one at this point of time I still think I should have just told us it was like for almost six months of time in my life where I was like just thinking of like going and talking to her but then I never did now now I don't care about her now probably she's happy I don't even know like it's been like ages since I spoke to her so every single thing that you care about in your life like literally every single thing everything and anything that you actually care which actually means something to you it can go right or it can go wrong and sadly it's not much near control all you can do to get the goal or probably pass in that exam is plan for it strategize for it work hard for it but the result it's not really in near control so the next time when you're worrying about something just say\n",

            " I'm gonna be 24 in a couple of days and if you're of age between 15 to 20, then the next 8 minutes are going to be the best 8 minutes of your life. So these are some of the most important lessons that I've learned in my life and I think you should definitely learn from my mistakes. The first thing, the biggest leverage that you have when you're of this age is that you have time. At the age of 18, people think that if I don't get into IIT or if I don't crack need, then my life is like gone and that's completely bullshit. What you have to understand is if you pick any skill, I mean to say any skill and try to get better at it by 1% every day. It'll not just be 37 times better at it by the end of the year but it'll actually be more than 1427 times better at it by the end of the second year. But people usually don't talk about this second or third or fourth year with a beautiful effect of compounding takes place. Now imagine you spend 5 years on any of the hot skills in the market. You'll launch this beat up 1%, but you'll actually beat up 0.01% of the people who know that skill and that is the secret to make a lot of money. So never underestimate the power of time and dedication. The starting would be slow but only the people who have patience will win in the long time. The second thing is said but what you have to understand is compounding works both the ways. It can make or break your life. I mean if you don't work towards your goals, if you keep wasting your time, if you don't go to gym, the difference between you and your friend who has actually worked hard, would be so so so much that you'll regret your entire life. So now the choice is yours and how are you going to spend the next 5 years of your life? And now let me tell you some stories which gave me like really really really massive results in my life. I was in the pre-finery of college like everyone around me was like preparing for internships because getting an internship almost guarantees you a placement in the final year. But then I was like fuck it, I would rather make some videos during the summers because I was like very very passionate about making videos back then. And guess what, my channel took a huge turn during the summer holidays and that was one of the major reasons why I got a better placement at the end of the college. Like everyone were calling me a fool back then but you know what, if you truly believe in something and if you give your blood, sweat and tears, the world will always support you. And a similar thing happened during the final year as well. Like I skipped an interview because I wanted to make a video for a brand and somehow my interview literally happened while I was travelling in a cab and there were like more than happy to give me the placement offer. I mean I didn't join it later but anyways I still had the offer, I still got the offer and the third show that happened last year, I finally took the courage to leave my previous job and I actually ended up with a better one later. So once a conclusion that you can derive, conclusion, one is that I'm stupid as fuck and I should have never taken that risk. But conclusion too, I mean you got the point. See you. The next biggest lesson that I've learnt is a bit controversial to what other people say. It's a bit controversial to say that I'm not a bad person. See our life depends upon how much value you can be provided to others and sadly no one would give a fuck about you if you're not really good at anything. So I would say learner skill, know how to provide value to others and then finally reach out to them by saying, hey I've been following you for a while now and you're doing amazing. I personally love the reason so and so work that you're dead and I specialize in so and so and so and if you need any help let me know I'll be more than happy to help you. This is how you should need work and this always works. Now what skills to learn is a video for a separate day. I mean just let me know in the comments below if you actually need a video on best skills to learn in 2025. I'd be more than happy to make a video. And the next one is the way that I live my life and this is a secret to get unlimited amount of energy and motivation. And it's actually very simple. See every six months I set a new set of goals. The first one is the amount of money that I need to earn, the skills that I need to learn, some kind of fitness goals and finally some kind of hobby which actually makes me feel alive. See a life is hard and it's really hectic to chase massive goals every single day. It's really hectic to wake up and go to work despite the way that we actually feel and it gets depressing sometimes when we see that everyone else is doing amazing while there's nothing working out for us. So it's very important to have one or two things in life which actually make us feel alive. For example when I was a kid I used to play a lot of chess but because of J.E. I had to stop it and I never got a chance to play it again. But since the last couple of months I started playing it back and it gives me an insane amount of energy, insane source of motivation to wake up every day and I feel excited for something every single day. So have a little hobby, have a form of creative outlet which gives you that source of energy. See this hobby for the next six months and I think I need to get to 2000, 2000 LOLS. So coming back to the point having goals is important but you know what's more important having deadlines. And now the last one in the list, no one actually gives a fuck about you and that's actually a good thing. Like when I was a kid I used to worry a lot about what would my friends think of me if I asked a very silly question in the class. And then growing up I came to college I used to think about what if the girl says no when I go and propose her. And then I also used to have like a lot of stage fear. What if I go to the stage start picking in front of everyone and then I somehow miss it up and then finally everyone would actually be a fun of me. So guess what? Make fun of me because it doesn't really matter because you, me and everyone who's watching me right now we all are going to die something.\n",
